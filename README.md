# OTT DBMS
## Created a database for a video streaming service like Amazon Prime, ensuring data is organized efficiently and easy to manage. Designed tables for users, shows, movies, transactions, and subscriptions, keeping everything neat and tidy. Linked different parts of the database together so it's easy to find and use information. Helped build a strong foundation for a smooth and user-friendly streaming platform.
